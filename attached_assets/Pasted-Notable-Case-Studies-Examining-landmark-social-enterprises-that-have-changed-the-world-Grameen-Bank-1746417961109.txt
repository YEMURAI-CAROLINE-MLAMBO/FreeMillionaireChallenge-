Notable Case Studies
Examining landmark social enterprises that have changed the world

Grameen Bank - Microfinance Revolution
Founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, Grameen Bank pioneered the microfinance model by providing small loans to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans, particularly women in rural areas.

Key Innovation:
The bank's group-lending model created social collateral, where borrowers formed small groups and became collectively responsible for each other's loans, resulting in repayment rates above 95%.

Impact:
Grameen has served over 9 million borrowers (97% women), distributed billions in loans, and inspired a global microfinance movement that has reached hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

Business Analysis:
Business case studies highlight how Grameen's model challenged conventional banking wisdom by demonstrating that the poor are "bankable" and that social capital can effectively replace financial collateral.
